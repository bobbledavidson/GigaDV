GigaDB (www.gigadb.org)  is the data repository for the open access journal, GigaScience (www.gigasciencejournal.com). GigaScience's remit is to promote and advance the concept of reproducibility and easy, open access in scientific publishing. Publications in GigaScience must make their data and software available for public access, reuse and scrutiny. GigaDB is GigaScience's public repository for biological, scientific data. 

GigaDV is intended to be a dataviewer for GigaScience journal so that scientific image data may be viewed by the public without the need for specialist image viewing software. GigaDV hopes to make use of OMERO's advanced features such as marking Regions of Interest (ROIs) on MRI data, improved annotation of images etc to enable better searching (access) of images and to directly make available basic analysis of the images.
